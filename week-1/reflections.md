### 1.1
1. I was most interested in the techniques to get in the "zone", because I love that feeling.  I also took a look at the alternative techniques and creating new habits. 
2. So Time-Boxing seems to me like a sort of soft-deadline system where an individual or group sets a goal and works towards it until a deadline, then sees how far they got.  I like this method because it puts pressure on the project, but spreads it out more evenly around the actual allotted time, instead of having the pressure skewed towards the end of the actual deadline.  
3. I have to admit that I do not have a specific method of time management right now.  I used to make lists and extensive plans, but stopped when I realized I had all these uncompleted or partially completed lists lying around everywhere. It was just depressing.  Right now I occasionally run into time management problems but I am most frustrated that work I do often lacks a clear direction from start to finish I guess. I definitely plan on trying to train my "focus" skills very gradually. To do this I will set a timer to work for ever increasing intervals.  If I "forget" about the timer 3 times in a row I will increase it slightly.
4. My strategy right now is to work about 3-4 hours a day, getting an overview of the challenges and topics the first few days and then focusing on individual ones until completed. 


### 1.2
1. A shell is a way that allows you to tell the computer what to do for you. Bash is one of these shells and works using a terminal interface. 
2. The method in which the material was presented felt strange to me how it showed me the what the terminal looked like first and then explained what happened. But it might have been better that way because it really forced me to look closely at it.
3. I was more or less able to use all of them after messing around a bit. 
4. Certainly the help or man command is a very very useful one to know, it lets you know about all the other ones! And I as a visual learner really need pwd and ls to sort of figure out where I am at all times.
5. Pwd- print working directory, shows the file path to where your commands will generally end up affecting.
..* ls - lists the files and folders in the current directory
..*mv - changes the name of a file or directory
..*cd - moves your current directory to a different one
..* ../ - refers to a folder directly above the current one
..* touch - creates a new (blank) file
..* mkdir- creates a new directory or folder
..* less - shows the contents of a file
..* rmdir - deletes an (empty) folder
..* rm - deletes files
..* help - gives you a description of how to use a command

### 1.4
1. To create a repo, navigate to your github page and find the plus sign, click new repository, and name it appropriately.  
2. To fork a repo means to make a copy for yourself. You can find the fork button on the repo's page. This makes a new copy on your account.
3. To clone means to make a copy onto your machine so you can work with it.  To do this you have to find the link on the repo page and use the git clone (link) command in the terminal.
 

Setting this up wasn't too bad honestly.  It seems like a very stream-lined service.
